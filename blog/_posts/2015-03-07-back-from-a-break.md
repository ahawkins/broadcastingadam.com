title: "Back from a Break"
---

This is my first post in about 10 months. I wanted to write, but I
didn't have the energy or interest. I had been working some larger
content (like the working with repositories series) but ran out of
energy towards the end. I was constantly considering finishing it but
a time never came up and things were continually punted down the road.
At the same time, my growing distaste for the Ruby language and it's
ecosystem soured me on writing about and trying to teach people how to
architect their applications in a better way. On top of that things
had drastically changed for me professionally around the time I
stopped blogging. I was promoted to platform team lead and put in
charge of managing a technical rewrite that grew into an entire
re-invisioning of a 3 year old product. After a large amount of hard
work, over time, and personal investment that's finally winding down.
This engineering effort provided my test bed for my new ideas on
system architecture and sure as hell taught me a lot about software
management, process management, product design, and whole ton of other
shit. It's been interesting experience and I've had some time to
reflect on my ideas, implementations, and learning experiences. I want
to share some of these things with you.

At this point, I'm still soured on the ruby ecosystem and many of the
ideas & practices. So don't expect to find any in depth Ruby content
from me anymore. I'd like to finish the working with repositories
series since I have that code in production for a few years now and
put through many different use cases. (I've also made some commits to
Chassis and have been collecting larger changes based on professional
experience). However, I'm still actively writing ruby in my own way
and still doing FOSS ruby gems if you know where to look. I think my
work from this point will be more language agnostic and focused on
software engineering process and high level system design. Here are
some things I've had on my mind recently:

* Thrift, Thrift, Thrift, & more Thrift!
* Fundamentally insane practices of the wider ruby community
* "Adam's Principles of Holistic System Design": trade offs,
  optimizations, and considerations for building large systems and
  their components
* The Big Rewrite (hint: don't)
* Docker & VMs for a polygot workflow
* Docker Orchestration (creating images is easy, shipping containers
  is the real challenge)
* Make is Great (& why I no longer use rake)
* Out of process & network testing
* Sane HTTP & JSON APIs with JSON schema
* Perspectives going from general developer to team lead (e.g. into
  "management")
* Virtualized & dockerized environments

There's probably more, but that's what I've had rattling around my
brain for the last 6 months or so. I'm looking forward so sharing this
stuff with you once I recover and gain some more energy. For those of
you how asked me questions on architecture, chassis, and many other
coding concerns, I'm sorry I could get back to you. Shoot me an email
again I'll see what I can do.
