title: "Fragmentation in the Ruby Community"
---

the Ruby community is fragmenting right now. There are two groups:
There are "Rails Developers" and "Ruby Developers". These two groups
are not the same. The Rails side of the community has it's own values
and the Ruby side cares about the opposite. In some ways it seems
there is the "Rails Way" and then there is everything else. It's sad
to me that as an entire programming language community we are obsessed
with Rails. There are those of us who do not work with Rails are even
use Ruby to write web applications--and that's great! How come we must
include Rails in every dicussion? If we are having talks about
software architecture and high level design concepts why do we have to
talk about Rails?

Apparently, I'm not ready to write this post yet. Some things I've
been thinking about:

* The ruby community deparetly needs new leadership
* leadership should not come from rails
* Let the rails way people play with their toys
* In some ways this whole thing just feels so noob to me: Are we
  seriously talking about if TDD is good?
* Ruby community has no clear ideals are important values
* Ruby community is obsessed with rails and must talk about it every
  turn
* We don't know how to exist without rails--we try to brute force it
  into every project
* These things impact the community in a negative way
* Fight against people need to use a web framework but must fight
  against rails because there is nothing else as complete in the
  ecosystem
* Not enough dicussion on high level software architecture, boundaries
  and constructing maintainable software
* All of things together make me consider my continued involvement in
  the community.
